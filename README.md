# Tobu Self Ref

`tobu-self-ref` is a (failed) prototype for creating a reflective type system like the one in use by
[protobuf-go](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect).

This project gets it name from `struct`s with self referential fields. Self referential `struct`s
can be used to tie reflective information to the concrete values.

For more information, see [the main project](https://github.com/ajguerrer/tobu).
